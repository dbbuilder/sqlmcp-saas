  - Deprecation policies

#### Core Features (Priority 2)
- [ ] CORE-001: Database Connection Management
  - Connection pooling optimization
  - Multi-database support
  - Connection string encryption

- [ ] CORE-002: Query Builder & Validator
  - Safe query construction
  - Parameter validation
  - Query plan analysis

- [ ] CORE-003: Schema Management
  - Schema comparison tools
  - Migration framework
  - Version control integration

#### Agent Features (Priority 3)

#### Testing & Quality (Ongoing)
- [ ] Integration test suite setup
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Load testing framework

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add XML documentation to all public APIs
- [ ] Implement request/response logging middleware
- [ ] Add distributed tracing support
- [ ] Create developer onboarding guide

## Next Session Focus
1. Start INFRA-006: Audit Logging System
2. Design audit event schema
3. Implement audit interceptor with TDD
4. Ensure correlation ID flows through audit logs

## Notes
- Maintain 95%+ test coverage for all new code
- Security review required before production deployment
- All database operations must use parameterized queries
- Follow TDD approach: tests first, then implementation
